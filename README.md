# Covid-19-Worldwide-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL




The main purpose of this project is to use SQL queries to analyze COVID-19 pandemic data. A dataset that offers data on COVID-19 instances, fatalities, population, and immunizations in various regions and continents will be the source of our work. The major goal is to obtain insightful knowledge and provide answers to significant pandemic-related queries.
SQL queries will be utilized to handle several facets of the COVID-19 data. A synopsis of the questions and the information they yield is as follows:

•	Mortality Rate: This query determines the proportion of fatalities compared to all cases. It aids in our comprehension of the virus's severity across various continents and locales. 
•	Population Infected Percentage: This query calculates the proportion of the population infected with COVID-19. We can assess how widely the virus is spreading in different areas by comparing the overall number of cases to the population size. 
•	Highest Infection Rate: The nation with the highest infection rate relative to its population is determined by this query. It determines the infected population's proportion and indicates the area with the highest value.
•	Greatest Death Rate: The nation with the greatest death rate per population is found with this query. It indicates the area with the highest mortality rate and computes the proportion of the population that has perished as a result of COVID-19. 
•	Nation with the Highest Death Count: This search identifies the nation with the highest overall death toll. It offers information about the nations where the virus is most prevalent. 
•	Continent with Highest Death Count: This search determines which continent has the greatest overall death toll. It aids in our comprehension of the pandemic's overall effects on a broader scale.
•	 Global Cases per Day: This query displays the total number of new cases and deaths from COVID-19 worldwide each day. In order to give us a sense of the virus's intensity over time, it also computes the death rate as a percentage of new cases.
•	Rolling Count of Vaccinated: This query determines the total number of vaccinated people for each day. It displays the population size combined with the total number of vaccinated individuals. It also displays the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated.

Joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions are a few SQL techniques that were employed in this project to extract information from the data. This project entails developing views to hold the findings of our investigations in addition to the SQL queries. These views can be used for reporting, data visualization, and additional investigation. 
Our project intends to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination campaigns, provide significant insights into the influence of the virus on various places, and comprehend the severity of the pandemic over time by utilizing SQL to analyze the COVID-19 data. The results of this project can help with resource allocation, well-informed decision-making, and the creation of successful public health initiatives.
